# Battleship
  This was the final project for our advanced C# class - a group project where the students were to create a single-player Battleship-type game according to project requirements. I served as project manager and lead developer/designer for our team of three programmers, creating the top-level design of the project and coding out the functional portions of the game. The other two developers developed the UI portions of the project  This project was a success in that our group created a functional game that met all of the requirements set forth by the instructor. We came very close to creating a more advanced AI that would enable the computer "player" to hone in on a target after the hit, rather than striking at random. I would have liked to have had time to generate some more advanced graphics, but we were short on time, and it was outside the scope of the project requirements anyway. Now that I have a much better grasp of good programming practices, I would have opted not to hard-code the individual instances of the ships, and instead generated those within the game class.
  
Included here are: a Classes folder, which contains only what I built/helped build, the Battleship folder, containing the complete source code, and a Battleship.zip file for easy downloading
